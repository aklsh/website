Just wanted to put up everything I use in one post. Who knows, maybe I can compare it with what I
have 5 years from now :-I ??

## Hardware

1. **ASUS Zephyrus G14**: Ryzen 4800HS, GTX1660Ti, 1TB SSD. The 1TB SSD does help in having enough
   space for both my Linux and Windows boots. Also Team Red <3.

2. **Logitech M331**: cheap, comfy and silent wireless mouse.

3. **Jaybird X3**: Great pair of wireless earphones. Although the battery life can be improved—constantly having to plug it in after just 4-5 hours of continuous use.

4. **OnePlus 6**: SD 845, 6GB RAM, 128GB storage. What more do I want from a phone? Haven't rooted
   it yet—will root it as soon as OnePlus drops support for software updates.

5. **SanDisk Ultra Dual Drive USB 3.0**: Got it when micro-USBs were ubiquitous. Now have changed it
   to my solution to all my live ISOs. Powered by Ventoy.

6. **Western Digital My Passport**: Nothing beats a good ol' backup on an external HDD. Mostly used for academic files.

## Software

1. **Manjaro Linux**: Bleeding-edge like Arch. Noob-resistant like Ubuntu. Best of both worlds. ~~Also, I didn't have the time nor patience to install vanilla Arch Linux in the middle of a really frustratingly hard semester. Soon<sup>TM</sup>~~.

2. **Windows 10**: Exclusively used for Fortnite and Among Us.

3. **KDE Plasma + i3**: Match made in heaven. i3's productivity when I'm in the zone. Plasma
   when I'm lazy watching YT.

4. **Neovim**: _The good parts of Vim and more_[^1]. Case in point: Lua instead of Vimscript.

5. **Firefox**: Does all the things I want and also the only browser (coincidentally) that supports
   insti's internal sites.

6. **pass**: Manages all my passwords. Use PassFF for integration with Firefox.

7. **Apple Music**: Can't really have a good local, offline setup for my 10,000+ song library—too much disk usage, and restricted to one device.
