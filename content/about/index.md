My name is Akilesh Kannan. You'll usually find me on the internet as `aklsh`. My interests lie mostly in the hardware-software interfaceâ€”low-level software (OS, networking), computer architecture and hardware accelerators. I am also huge supporter of Open-Source Software and Open Hardware.

Here's somethings that you can talk to me about:

1. Hardware. All kinds: Processors, Security, GPUs, Laptops, PC Builds etc.
2. TV Shows. Name any english TV show and I've probably watched it.
3. Music. Alternative, Rock, Electronic.
4. Ricing. I sometimes post my rices on r/unixporn.
5. Gaming. I play with a controller instead of a keyboard.
6. Motorsport. I keep up with F1,2,3,E and am an avid fan of Scuderia Ferrari (sad noises).

Here's my [resume](https://cdn.aklsh.me/resume.pdf) if you're interested in my professional life.

### Colophon
This site is made with [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo), a static site generator written in Go. It uses a _heavily modified_ version of the [Codex theme](https://github.com/jakewies/hugo-theme-codex) by [Jake Wiesler](https://www.jakewiesler.com). It uses minimal JavaScript for rendering $\LaTeX$ and a responsive navigation burger menu, improved accessibility for screen readers.
